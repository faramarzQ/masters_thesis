Rename active class to power class

Heuristic scaler:
    scale out a specific number of nodes to meet a target utilization

Silencer:
    Scales in nodes periodically

    for each node checks if
        it has only one pod &&
        the pod is inactive(zero util):

        then set a idle_at label
    
    if it is not idle, remove the idle_at label
    if more than on pod exists, remove th idle_at label

    for each node checks if
        it has only one pod &&
        the pod is inactive(zero util) &&
        it already has a idle_at label &&
        the idle_at value is [less] than the_given_idle_time_threshold:

        then continue

    for each node checks if
        it has only one pod &&
        the pod is inactive(zero util) &&
        it already has a idle_at label &&
        the idle_at value is [greater] than the_given_idle_time_threshold:

        then turn of the node

Random scheduler:
    Problem: does not consider node scores
