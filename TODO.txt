Heuristic scaler:
    scale out a specific number of nodes(with a specific amount of resources) to meet a target utilization

Cluster:



Node Silencer:
    Scales-in nodes periodically

    - idle to off
        If has been idle for a specific period:
            then change to off


Random scheduler:
    Problem: does not consider node scores

Proposed scheduler:
