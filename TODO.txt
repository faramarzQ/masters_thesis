Heuristic scaler:
    scale out a specific number of nodes(with a specific amount of resources) to meet a target utilization

Cluster:
    A function to select the efficient node for scaling
    Calculate energy consumption of a node during a specific time
    Get success request rate of requests

Node Silencer:


Random scheduler:
    Problem: does not consider node scores

Proposed scaler:
    Implement RL model
