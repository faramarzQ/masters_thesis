Heuristic scaler:

Cluster:
    Calculate energy consumption of a node during a specific time

Node Silencer:

Random scheduler:
    Problem: does not consider node scores

Proposed scaler:
    Implement RL model
        Pass necessary metrics to RL server to update the Q-Table
        Take action after receiving action from RL server
