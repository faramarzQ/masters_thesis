Heuristic scaler:
    scale out a specific number of nodes(with a specific amount of resources) to meet a target utilization

Cluster:
    - Only consider off, idle and active classes
    - Add annotation
    - Add active scaler's name as annotation to the master node



Node Silencer:
    Scales-in nodes periodically

    - active to idle
        If node has no function:
            then change to idle

        If nodes' functions are utilized:
            pass

        If has warm function &&
            has been warm for a period of time:
            then change to idle

        If has warm function &&
            has not been warm for a specific period of time:
            pass

    - idle to off
        If has been idle for a specific period:
            then change to off


Pod Silencer:
    if an active node has only one pod &&
        that pod has zero util &&
        then add idle label with current time annotation

Random scheduler:
    Problem: does not consider node scores

Proposed scheduler:
